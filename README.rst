Introduction
============

This is the plone.org Plone add-on and buildout used to power http://plone.org.
It may also be used to develop Plone.org-centric add-ons such as
PloneSoftwareCenter, PloneHelpCenter, PloneServicesCenter, and Poi.

.. Note::

    The currently supported Plone version is: 4.2.x.

Installation
============

Copy ``buildout.cfg.in`` to ``buildout.cfg`` and uncomment one of the following profiles.

Development
-----------

Instructions.

Clone::

    git clone git@github.com:plone/Products.PloneOrg.git

Create b.out::

    cp buildout.cfg.in buildout.cfg

Edit it::

    [buildout]
    # Rename to buildout.cfg and uncomment one of the profiles below
    extends =
    # Copy data local (with plone.org account)
        conf/database.cfg

Set up your `SSH keys for plone.org <http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/10/24/ssh-key-and-passwordless-login-basics-for-developers/>`_.

Run buildout::

    python bootstrap.py -v 1.6.3
    bin/buildout

This will create p.org configuration and rsync cleaned ``Data.fs``
and related files from plone.org for your local computer. The data
size is around 5 GB (2013/04), so see instructions below
how to avoid the copying in the future buildout runs.

Create an admin user for yourself::

    bin/instance adduser admin2 admin

Start::

    bin/instance fg

(First startup after fresh Data.fs copy takes time.)

Visit `http://localhost:8080/plone.org <http://localhost:8080/plone.org>`_.

Admin password is ``admin2`` / ``admin``.

Rebuilding the copy
------------------------

To run buildout without sync::

    bin/buildout install instance omelette  # And other parts here you might need here too

Deployment
==============

First test your changes on the staging server, then deploy on plone.org primary.

Staging
----------

In the case if you don't have ``staging.plone.org`` domain record add to your ``/etc/hosts``::

    74.203.223.202 staging.plone.org

**Note**: Always use http:// URLs to access staging, as https:// URLs are not currently routed correctly and
end up to live *plone.org*.

Example how to update ``staging.plone.org`` (was a bit of the horror story)::

    ssh plone.org

    # Test on staging
    sudo -i -u zope
    cd /srv/staging.plone.org
    # See we are running before starting to mess with things
    bin/supervisorctl status

    # Pull in patched Products.PloneOrg, run buildout, restart
    git pull
    /usr/local/Python-2.6.5/bin/python2.6 bootstrap.py -v1.7.1  # Let's fix that zc.buildout upgrade problem
    bin/buildout -c conf/staging.cfg
    exit

    # supervisord restart must be pulled in as a root
    cd /srv/staging.plone.org
    sudo bash -c "bin/supervisorctl stop all && sleep 1 && bin/supervisorctl shutdown && sleep 1 && bin/supervisord && bin/supervisorctl start all"

    # Check it came up
    sudo bin/supervisorctl status

    # Check instance1 is running
    telnet 10.57.0.107 6011

    # Check nginx is running
    telnet 10.57.0.107 6021

    # NOTE: Make sure dist.plone.org is not controlled by staging nginx?
    # See /usr/local/etc/varnish/default.vcl

    # See that http://staging.plone.org comes up
    # Login with your live LDAP credentials to http://staging.plone.org/login
    # Test your patch


Live
------

Update live *plone.org*::

    sudo -i -u zope
    cd /srv/plone.org
    git pull
    bin/buildout -c conf/production.cfg
    bin/supervisorctl stop plone.org-client-instance{1,2,3,4} && sleep 10 && bin/supervisorctl start plone.org-client-instance{1,2,3,4}

    # Test instance1 respoends
    telnet 10.57.0.107 5011

    # Restart the rest of the stuff
    sleep 120 && bin/supervisorctl stop plone.org-client-instance{5,6,7,8} && sleep 10 && bin/supervisorctl start plone.org-client-instance{5,6,7,8}

There is also ``fabfile.py``, but I am not sure how useful it is, as there is no instructions or indication of maintenance.
